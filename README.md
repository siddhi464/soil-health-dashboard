## 📌 Problem Statement  
Soil degradation and declining microbial biodiversity are silently undermining global agriculture—particularly in regions like India—by reducing crop yields, exhausting soil vitality, and threatening long-term food security. Most farmers lack access to tools that assess soil health, analyze microbial life, or offer actionable guidance for smarter farming.
